#wait-groups

welcome to my wait-group learning journey


wait groups is one of the ways we can control the way we're executing things simultaneously
if you would look at the self implementation of this repo you can get the best example of whats happening behind
we have 3 main functions to control the wait group with:
Add->for telling how many times to wait
Done->telling the system that one time happened
wait->waiting for all the times before continue


look at each example and try to play with it
best way to really understand is writing it yourself so go hands on!
